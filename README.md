Your task is to build two apps for the Washington Herald. The particulars are listed below. Given the large readership of the Washinton Herald, this is a high priority project. You will have **two weeks** to build a working prototype with some polish. 

###News Reader App

This app will be public facing and has the following requirements:

- Login
- View recent stories
- View stories by category
- View information about an author
- Free text search for stories
- Splash screen and icon
- Must work on 4 inch and 3.5 inch screens

###Writers App

This app will be private and used by the writers to manage their stories:

- Login
- View author information
- View the logged in writer's stories
- Add, edit, and remove stories
- Splash screen and icon
- Must work on 4 inch and 3.5 inch screens

###Available Resources

The web team has already sketched out a web service to log you in and give you access to the stories. A link to their API page can be found [here](https://mobileweb.caps.ua.edu/cs491/help)

###Accounts

Contact the project lead for your test credentials. Multiple accounts for readers and writers are available.
